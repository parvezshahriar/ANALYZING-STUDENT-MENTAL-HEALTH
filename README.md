# Data Analysis Project


Does going to university in a different country affect your mental health?  
A Japanese international university surveyed its students in 2018 and published a study the following year that was approved by several ethical and regulatory boards.

The study found that international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population, and that **social connectedness** (belonging to a social group) and **acculturative stress** play a crucial role in well-being.

##  Project Summary

This project analyzes data from that study using Python and common data science tools to explore:

- The correlation between acculturative stress and depression
- The impact of social support on mental health
- Insights into the psychological state of international students
